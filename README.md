# jQuery Micro Challenges

Hey everyone! Here are a series of jQuery challenges that already have code built out, but are missing some component, or some component is incorrect. Follow the instructions to see if you and your peer can figure out the correction.

Inside this repo, you will find a 'challenges' folder. Work your way through each file within that folder. Complete each of the files. Make the changes, save the file, and move onto the next file. Do this until you have completed each of the files.

**Do not change anything in the body of the html.** These are jQuery challenges. The only thing that should change in the html is which file to source. Put your code where it says `YOUR CODE HERE`.
